# location

## deck

You are on the deck of the ferry.

The deck has a number of benches and chairs for passengers to use. It's
windy today, so few people are out here.

You look around. The ferry is surrounded by the ocean for as far as the
eye can see.

## cabin

You are on the cabin of the ferry.

The ship's captain is here, along with the first mate. They welcome passengers
to join them in the cabin, to see them steer and navigate the ship. There
are radar screens showing the clouds that surround the ship, and a few other
blips - perhaps other vessels in the distance.
