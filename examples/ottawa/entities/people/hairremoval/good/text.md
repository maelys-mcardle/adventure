## unpurchased -> purchased

You approach the person at the desk to buy a session.

She asks you to fill out forms, which you do, as its your first time here.
The forms ask for what medication you're taking, to which you put spironolactone
and estradiol.

## purchased -> removal

You are asked to come in to do the session.

The technician gets you to lay back on a dentist's chair and asks you if 
you want a stress ball. You say yes. She puts protective glasses over your
eyes and narrates what she is doing.

She gently puts a cool gel over your face. This will help reduce the pain, she
says. The session starts. It hurts, especially around the nose and jaw. It's
soon over.
