## unpurchased -> purchased

You approach the person at the desk to buy a session.

She ask you if you're sure, and that she wouldn't let her own son do this. 
She seems to think you're a man. You point out the gender marker on your health
card that says you're female.

She asks you to fill out forms, which you do, as its your first time here.
The forms ask for what medication you're taking, to which you put spironolactone
and estradiol.

The price seems a lot higher than they advertised, but you pay up anyways.

The imposing figure asks you to wait in the chair. You do.

You wait. It looks like the technician went off to lunch, so the imposing
figure comes in ten minutes later. She says she looked up what medications
you're on and start to berate you over them.

That medication has made huge improvements to your quality of life. But it
took 15 months of work, a psychiatric assessment and medical evaluation to
get them because everyone is so afraid of trans people.

She is saying how you shouldn't be on these medication that have literally
been life-saving for you, and brings up if you were her son again. You 
say nothing. You've spent a small fortune on this laser hair removal session,
you just want this to be done with.

She finally gets around to start the session. No prep, just the laser amped 
up against your face. It hurts like hell.

This is the worst laser hair removal session you've ever had.
