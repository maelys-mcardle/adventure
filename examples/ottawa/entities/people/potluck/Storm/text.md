## idle

Storm is hanging out by the window.

## hello

You say hi to Storm.

They reply "hey!" with a smile.

## howAreYou: how are you?

You ask Storm how they're doing.

"I'm doing good. I just finished my shift so I'm a little tired. I'm supposed 
to be going camping this weekend, so we'll see how that goes if I have the
energy for that."

## howIsWork: how is work?

You ask Storm how their work is going.

"Work is ehhh. I had a customer today that got super angry that I served
them coffee in a paper cup instead of a mug. Like just being really nasty
about it. And like the shifts are all over the place, I'm tired you know?
Plus school doesn't help."

## howIsSchool: how is school?

You ask Storm about school.

"Yeah it's fine. This isn't what I thought a Masters in Social Work was going
to be like. I'm doing a lot more coursework than I expected, and whenever
trans stuff comes up, it's super painful. I'm told I'm wrong, about my own
experiences, when they don't know the first thing about trans stuff. And they're
marking me based off of that crap."
