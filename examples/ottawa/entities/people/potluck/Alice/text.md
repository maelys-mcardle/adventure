## idle

Alice is keeping an eye on the oven.

## hello

You say hi to Alice.

"Hey!" she says, keeping her eye on the stove.

## howAreYou: how are you?

You ask Alice how she's doing.

"Fine. I've been doing a lot of biking and have been reading queer comics
from the eighties. I have fewer clients than I was hoping for by this time, 
which isn't the best, but life is good. I'm doing more church stuff these days; 
I'm going to a religious retreat in a week."

## howIsWork: how is work?

You ask Alice how her work is going.

"With the two main sites I was using no longer accepting ads for escorts,
it's harder. And like the list of bad clients got taken down too, which
sucks. I'm doing okay but it's stressful."

## howIsChurch: how is church?

You ask Alice about church.

"It's good! I go to an Anglican church downtown. It uses traditional
liturgy, but like, we also sing to Bob Dylan? And like there's a bunch
of other trans people there? And the older people are super cool? It's
like another family for me now."

## whatAreYouMaking: what are you making?

You ask Alice what she's got in the oven.

"Buffalo cauliflower wings. I've never made this recipe before, I hope
it turns out well," she says laughing.
