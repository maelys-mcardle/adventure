# conversation

## idle

Finn is eating some food.

## hello

You say hi to Finn.

She replies "hi there."

## howAreYou: how are you?

You ask Finn how they're doing.

"I have to move because I can't afford my place anymore. I'm going to
be looking for people to help me with that. I attended the consult at the 
community clinic for trans health care. I think they're going to listen
this time. Or that's the hope. There was a lot of us. The poetry is going
well too."

## helpWithMove: I'll help you move

You tell Finn you'll help them move.

"Oh great! Thanks, I'll message you in a week."

## howIsPoetry: how is your poetry?

You ask Finn how their poetry is going.

"I'm almost done my book. I should have something out soon. I was able
to get another computer; now I've got to type out the poetry I've written
out over the past two months."

## howWasConsult: how was the consultation?

You ask Finn about the consultation.

"You know how it is. They get money for our health care. It's cis people
who run it, cis people who decide how it gets spent, and we get bad care.
So we fight, then they invite us, and then they ignore what we say. But 
this time it felt a little different."
