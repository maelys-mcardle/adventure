You approach the person at the desk to buy a session.

She ask you if you're sure, and that she wouldn't let their son do this. 
She seems to think you're a man. 

She asks you to fill out forms, which you do, as its your first time here.
The forms ask for what medication you're taking, to which you put spironolactone
and estradiol.

Then she ask you to wait in the chair. You do.

You wait. It looks like the technician went off to lunch, so the imposing
figure comes in ten minutes later. She says she looked up what medications
you're on and start to berate you over them.

These meds saved your life. But you don't bother speaking up.

The session finally starts. No prep, just the laser amped up against your face.

This is the worst laser hair removal session you've ever had.
