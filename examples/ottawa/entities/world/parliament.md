## parliamentHill: Parliament Hill

You are on Parliament Hill.

You are by the Centennial Flame, a large circular fountain decorated with
the coat of arms of each province and territory. In the center is a torch,
eternally lit.

Around you is the large lawn before the Parliament buildings. On Wednesdays,
it is full of mostly-women practicing yoga. This is also a site of many
protests, including when you faced down white supremacists last month.

## parliamentBuildings: Parliament buildings

You are by the Parliament buildings.

The nineteenth century, castle-like building is absolutely massive. You
are in awe of the work that went into it. The art in every facet, every
gargoyle, ever window.

You've been inside many times, along with seemingly every transphobic
asshat in the country, first fighting the government who was trying to
push a bill to explicitly legalize discrimination on the basis of gender
identity, and later, to advocate for a bill that did the opposite.
