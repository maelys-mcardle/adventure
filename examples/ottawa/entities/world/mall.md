## mallMain: shopping center entrance

You are in the Rideau Street Mall. This is the city's largest indoor shopping
center, which has had several facelifts in recent years as its gained prestige.

## mallFoodCourt: food court

The food court looks like it belongs to a rich person's contemporary home.
All the tables, furniture, shops look modern and stylish. The food joints
cater to young professional tastes: a specialty burger joint, an overpriced
grilled cheese place, sushi stall, etc.

It's very different from the old food court, which had more affordable food
options and had become a popular place for street youth and older folks 
without shelter to spend time indoors and socialize. 

## mallLaserHairRemoval: laser hair removal salon

You are in the laser hair removal salon. 

An imposing figure sits at the desk. Behind her is a television that appears
to have a large crack running through the screen. The overhead lights are off,
which is rather unexpected.

## mallClothing: clothing store

You are in the clothing store. The clothes here are on the more affordable
side of things and they have larger sizes.

## mallSports: sports shop

You are in the sports shop. It's small, it's mostly athletic clothes or
sporty-style everyday wear. The sales associate offers you help, and
has no qualms about recommending women's wear that would fit your style.
They keep calling you "sir". They think you're a man wanting to wear women's
clothes.

Everything in here is super pricey. You can't afford to buy many things
here, though you're inclined to do so.

## mallGenericCoffee: coffee shop

You are in the mall's coffee shop, which is just off of the food court.

It has its own seating area, with a faux rustic design made to look like
you're inside of an old barn. The seats aren't that comfortable. Windows
in the coffee shop onto Dalhousie Street.

## mallWashrooms: washrooms entrance

You are in the hallway to the shopping center's washrooms.

## mallMensWashroom: men's washrooms

You enter the washrooms. Your heart sinks being here, but it's the
washroom where you're least likely to be harassed. 

The washroom is filty. If you go pee here you're going to want to hover 
above the toilet.

## mallWomensWashroom: women's washrooms

You enter the washroom. It's clean.
