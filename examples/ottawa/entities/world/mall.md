## mallMain: shopping center entrance

You are in the Rideau Street Mall. This is the city's largest indoor shopping
center, which has had several facelifts in recent years as its gained prestige.

## mallFoodCourt: food court

The food court looks like it belongs to a rich person's contemporary home.
All the tables, furniture, shops look modern and stylish. The food joints
cater to young professional tastes: a specialty burger joint, an overpriced
grilled cheese place, sushi stall, etc.

It's very different from the old food court, which had more affordable food
options and had become a popular place for street youth and older folks 
without shelter to spend time indoors and socialize. 

## mallLaserHairRemoval: laser hair removal salon

You are in the laser hair removal salon. 

An imposing figure sits at the desk. Behind her is a television that appears
to have a large crack running through the screen. The overhead lights are off,
which is rather unexpected.

## mallWashrooms: washrooms entrance

You are in the hallway to the shopping center's washrooms.

## mallMensWashroom: men's washrooms

You enter the washrooms. Your heart sinks being here, but it's the
washroom where you're least likely to be harassed. 

The washroom is filty. If you go pee here you're going to want to hover 
above the toilet.

## mallWomensWashroom: women's washrooms

You enter the washroom. It's clean.
