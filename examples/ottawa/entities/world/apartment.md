This is a short work of interactive fiction that takes place during a
summer day in the city of Ottawa, Canada.

To start the game, enter your bedroom.

## apartment

### aptBedroom: bedroom

You are in your bedroom.

There are a number of pipes overhead that are humming. One of them you figure
is the hot water, one is the sewer, one is cold water, and the other two you
have no idea.

You've installed modern-looking lights on the walls to make up for the lack of 
lighting in this basement apartment. Your best friend also painted the walls 
of this room for you into a really nice colour.

You have no closets, but between your bookshelf and wire clothes drawer, along
with your minimalist attitude, you're not lacking for space.

French doors connect your bedroom to the living area.

### aptLivingSpace: living area

You are in your living area. 

For your bachelor apartment, this means your dining room, living room,
pantry, and office wrapped into one.

Against one wall you have a two-person dining table with accompanying chairs.
Overlooking the table is a canvas with graffiti art on it.

Opposite is your desk with your computer set-up. Beside that is the tunnel,
and on the other side of the tunnel is a wire shelf with all your kitchen
equipment and various ingredients.

You also have two skateboards as pieces of art in this room, hung from the
walls. One has a painting made by a local urban artist. The other was made 
by street youth to make money after the city kicked them out from one of the
only safe spots to sleep at night.

### aptTunnel: tunnel

You are in the tunnel. It seems to have once connected to your building on
the one opposite. Likely your apartment was once furnace room for the building
before being converted into a bachelor. 

Someone put shelfs against the tunnel walls, and you now use this space as
storage. Your vacuum cleaner, winter clothes, all go here.

### aptKitchen: kitchen

You are in your kitchen.

The kitchen is about two meters long, and less than a meter wide. Still, this
is enough space.

You have an apartment sized fridge, a stove that you cleaned furiously after
the previous tenant left food in there for what looked like a month, and a
few bug traps.

There is a small window at the top, that faces the ground of a dark alley
between your building and that next door.

There's a hole in your ceiling from the leak upstairs. You had told your
property manager about the situation for two weeks before the ceiling collapsed.
They finally fixed the leak upstairs, but haven't fixed the ceiling yet.

### aptBathroom: bathroom

You are in your bathroom.

This was nasty when you moved in here. Your friends though scrubbed much of 
it clean, and you eventually were able to get the urine stains off of the walls.
A bright yellow shower curtain now brings a bit of life into this appartment.

### aptEntrance: your unit entrance

You are in the entrance to your apartment unit.

### aptHallway: hallway

You are in the hallway of your apartment building.

The carpets on the floor are all ripped off. They have been since a month
after you moved in here. You assume the property owners failed to pay
the contractor to finish the job.

There is a large gaping hole in the wall. This is probably where the mail
boxes were, before mail boxes were installed outside.

### aptBuildingEntrance: your apartment building entrance

You are in the entrance to your apartment building.
