## start

This is a story about a period of my life in my home-town of Ottawa.

You'll get to walk through my shoes.

To start the game, enter your bedroom.

## apartment

### aptBedroom: bedroom

You are in your bedroom.

There are a number of pipes overhead that are humming. One of them you figure
is the hot water, one is the sewer, one is cold water, and the other two you
have no idea.

You've installed cool lights on the walls to make up for the lack of lighting
in this basement apartment. Your best friend also painted the walls of this
room for you into a really nice colour.

You have no closets, but between your bookshelf and wire clothes drawer, along
with your minimalist attitude, you're not lacking for space.

Glass doors connect your bedroom to the living area.

### aptLivingSpace: living area

You are in your living area.

This common space has your two-person dining table and your computer desk.

### aptTunnel: tunnel

You are in the tunnel. It seems to have once connected to the building on
the other side. Likely this apartment was a furnace room for the building
before being converted into a bachelor. 

You use this space as storage.

### aptKitchen: kitchen

You are in your kitchen.

You have an apartment sized fridge, a stove that you cleaned furiously after
the previous tenant left food in there for what looked like a month, and a
few bug traps.

There is a small window at the top, that faces the ground of a dark alley
between your building and that next door.

There's a hole in your ceiling from the leak upstairs. You had told your
property manager about the situation for two weeks before the ceiling collapsed.
They finally fixed the leak upstairs, but haven't fixed the ceiling yet.

### aptBathroom: bathroom

You are in your bathroom.

### aptEntrance: your apartment entrance

You are in the entrance to your apartment unit.

### aptHallway: building hallway

You are in the hallway of your apartment building.

The carpets on the floor are all ripped off. They have been since a month
after you moved in here. You assume the property owners failed to pay
the contractor to finish the job.

There is a large gaping hole in the wall. This is probably where the mail
boxes were, before mail boxes were installed outside.

### aptBuildingEntrance: your apartment building entrance

You are in the entrance to your apartment building.
