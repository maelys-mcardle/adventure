## shopGayCoffee: gay coffee shop

You are in the gay coffee shop. It has a name, but this is what all your
friends know it as. It has big large windows, comfy vegan leather chairs,
and all the staff is queer and/or trans.

When one of your friends work, they often generously give you a free cup of
coffee or treat, with some excuse. "Employee discount". "It was imperfect".
