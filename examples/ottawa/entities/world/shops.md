## shopGayCoffee: gay coffee shop

You are in the gay coffee shop. It has a name, but this is what all your
friends know it as. It has big large windows, comfy vegan leather chairs,
and all the staff is queer and/or trans.

You like to come read here.

They serve coffees, lattes, croissants and muffins here.

## shopHipsterCoffee: hipster coffee shop

You are in the hipster coffee shop.

There is padded seating and music playing that would satisfy a hipster.
There is a selection of coffee, lattes and baked goods. The men working here
almost all have thick lumberjack beards and a gentle demeanor. 

The music is a tad too loud and the seating a little too uncomfortable to want
to come and read here.

## shopLaserHairRemoval: laser hair removal salon

You are in the laser hair removal salon. 

A person at the desk greets you, and talks to her colleague. The place
is brightly lit and super clean.
