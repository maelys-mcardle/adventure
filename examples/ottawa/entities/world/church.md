## churchEntrance: church entrance

You are in the church entrance.

You hear contemporary music, and people laughing. You're in the rear of the
church, the people seem to be in the main hall. In between you is a glass
room that seems to be the Sunday school, and another just like it that seems
to be an office space.

## churchHall: church hall

You are in the main hall of the church.

There are people at the front. It looks to be a rehearsal. There's a lady
with purple hair, a few teens, a few young adults. There's an octegenarian
on drums. They acknowledge you, and continue practising.
