## potluckApartment: apartment with the potluck

You are at the apartment where the potluck is being held.

It is full of people talking with each other, with some food off to the side.
You overhear snippets of people talking about how their social worker degree
is going, complaining about their prof who painfully and incorrectly covered
trans stuff, laughing at averse experiences being queer in Ottawa, vegan dishes 
that have been baked, places that have been hiked.

## potluckKitchen: kitchen

You are in the kitchen. It is packed with people.

There is a large dish in the oven, you're not too sure what it is. 
Vegetables are being cooked on one round, while on the other marinated
tofu is now being fried.

## potluckWashroom: washroom

You are in the washroom. 

A small window looks onto the fire escape. The old tub and 1930's tile floors
are contrasted by the bright and colourful shower curtain. You have a moment
of privacy.
