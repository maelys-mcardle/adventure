## streets

### bank: Bank Street

You are on Bank Street.

This is a long street in the heart of Ottawa's downtown.

There are pride flags hanging from buildings, and rainbow stickers on shop
fronts. Young gay people don't live here anymore; no longer facing the barriers
that forced them into safe enclaves. Gay businesses have down-sized or
shuttered.

Trans people have meanwhile come in to find essential services and community. 
They are left with what is left. The pride stickers on these shop windows aren't
for them; they're by business owners who think LGBT means cute gay couples.

The cross-walks are painted rainbow colours at the intersection with Somerset.

There is a grocery store on this street.

### bronson: Bronson Street

You are on Bronson Street.

This is a working class neighbourhood right next to Chinatown and Ottawa's
highrises. There are houses divided up into multiple apartments lining the
entire street with relatively affordable rent. Like other aging neighbourhoods
that haven't been gentrified away, the houses are all old and unlike one 
another.

### clarence: Clarence Street

You are on Clarence Street.

This is the heart of the Byward Market. There are pubs lining the street,
tourist traps, and food vendors. Tourists invade the market during the day,
university students come at night to drink.

Everyone else who lives in Ottawa tends to avoid the market unless they work 
nearby. There's simply not much to do here.

### cooper: Cooper Street

You are on Cooper Street.

Aging apartment buildings line this downtown street. They're all no more than
three stories tall, with 6 or so apartments on each floor. Your building was
built in the 1930's at the latest, and most other buildings here seem to be
from the same era.

The Community Health Clinic is also on this street. They're the whole reason
you moved here, so you could be in their catchment area and get trans health
care from the only provider you know can give you a referral when you don't
have a doctor.

### dalhousie: Dalhousie Street

You are on Dalhousie Street.

This street on the edge of the Byward Market has boutiques with high-end
clothing, two full emergency shelters, a church that was sold to become a 
community space and hosted a BDSM event you went to, and a bunch of food joints
including a great Mexican restaurant that's in the basement of one of the
buildings.

The startup you worked at is also on this street, on the second floor of
one of these buildings.

### elgin: Elgin Street

You are on Elgin Street.

City Hall and the provincial court are on this street.

This street is home to one of Ottawa's most famous hotels. This is where
movie stars and hockey players tend to stay when they're in town. They used
to have a bar in the basement, which is one of the places where gay people 
would go in the 1960's to chill and cruise.

There are also a bunch of pubs and one of Ottawa's most famous diners on this
street. During weekend evenings, these will be full of young professionals
getting shit faced, before then going to the 24 hour diner.
