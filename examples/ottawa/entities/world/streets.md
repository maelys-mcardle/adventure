### bank: Bank Street

You are on Bank Street.

There are pride flags hanging from buildings, and rainbow stickers on shop
fronts. Young gay people don't live here anymore; no longer facing the barriers
that forced them into safe enclaves. Gay businesses have down-sized or
shuttered.

Trans people have come in to find essential services and community. The pride
stickers on shop fronts aren't for them.

### clarence: Clarence Street

This is the heart of the Byward Market. There are pubs lining the street,

university students come at night to drink.

Everyone else who lives in Ottawa tends to avoid the market unless they work 
nearby. There's simply not much to do here.
