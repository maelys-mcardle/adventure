### bank: Bank Street

This is a long street in the heart of Ottawa's downtown.

There are pride flags hanging from buildings, and rainbow stickers on shop
fronts. Young gay people don't live here anymore; no longer facing the barriers
that forced them into safe enclaves. Gay businesses have down-sized or
shuttered.

Trans people have meanwhile come in to find essential services and community. 
They are left with what is left. The pride stickers on these shop windows aren't
for them; they're by business owners who think LGBT means cute gay couples.

The cross-walks are painted rainbow colours at the intersection with Somerset.

There is a grocery store on this street.
