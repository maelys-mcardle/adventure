## streets

### bank: Bank Street

You are on Bank Street.

This is a long street in the heart of Ottawa's downtown.

There are pride flags hanging from buildings, and rainbow stickers on shop
fronts. Young gay people don't live here anymore; no longer facing the barriers
that forced them into safe enclaves. Gay businesses have down-sized or
shuttered.

Trans people have meanwhile come in to find essential services and community. 
They are left with what is left. The pride stickers on these shop windows aren't
for them; they're by business owners who think LGBT means cute gay couples.

The cross-walks are painted rainbow colours at the intersection with Somerset.

There is a grocery store on this street.

### bronson: Bronson Street

You are on Bronson Street.

This is a working class neighbourhood right next to Chinatown and Ottawa's
highrises. There are houses divided up into multiple apartments lining the
entire street with relatively affordable rent. Like other aging neighbourhoods
that haven't been gentrified away, the houses are all old and unlike one 
another.

### clarence: Clarence Street

You are on Clarence Street.

This is the heart of the Byward Market. There are pubs lining the street,
tourist traps, and food vendors. Tourists invade the market during the day,
university students come at night to drink.

Everyone else who lives in Ottawa tends to avoid the market unless they work 
nearby. There's simply not much to do here.

### cooper: Cooper Street

You are on Cooper Street.

Aging apartment buildings line this downtown street. They're all no more than
three stories tall, with 6 or so apartments on each floor. Your building was
built in the 1930's at the latest, and most other buildings here seem to be
from the same era.

The Community Health Clinic is also on this street. They're the whole reason
you moved here, so you could be in their catchment area and get trans health
care from the only provider you know can give you a referral when you don't
have a doctor.

### dalhousie: Dalhousie Street

You are on Dalhousie Street.

This street on the edge of the Byward Market has boutiques with high-end
clothing, two full emergency shelters, a church that was sold to become a 
community space and hosted a BDSM event you went to, and a bunch of food joints
including a great Mexican restaurant that's in the basement of one of the
buildings.

The startup you worked at is also on this street, on the second floor of
one of these buildings.

### elgin: Elgin Street

You are on Elgin Street.

City Hall and the provincial court are on this street.

This street is home to one of Ottawa's most famous hotels. This is where
movie stars and hockey players tend to stay when they're in town. They used
to have a bar in the basement, which is one of the places where gay people 
would go in the 1960's to chill and cruise.

There are also a bunch of pubs and one of Ottawa's most famous diners on this
street. During weekend evenings, these will be full of young professionals
getting shit faced, before then going to the 24 hour diner.

### george: George Street

You are on George Street.

You are in the heart of the Byward Market. There is a perpetual farmer's 
market here, with fresh local produce. A large open-concept building is at
the center of the stalls containing bakeries, souvenier shops, and take-out 
joints aimed largely at tourists.

There is also a beaver tail stall and independent ice cream parlour here. 
In the century old buildings lining the street are French-language book store, 
a shop in a particularly drafty old building that sells designer furniture and 
housewares, an art gallery, and niche food joints.

### gilmour: Gilmour Street

You are on Gilmour Street.

This street is residential, in the heart of Centretown. A series of old
buildings line the streets, not one like the other.

### kingEdward: King Edward Avenue

You are on King Edward Avenue.

This arterial road connects the bridge to Quebec on one end, with the highway
further down the other. On the north side of Rideau, the road is situated on 
the outer edge of the Byward Market side. There's a car garage here, a few 
emergency shelters, a place that sells tombstones.

On the south side of Rideau, the busy road is in Sandy Hill. This area is
largely residential, and the street is dotted with a number of churches.

### rideau: Rideau Street

You are on Rideau Street. 

This is a central road to Ottawa's downtown. The city's fanciest mall is
situated on one end, along with one of the city's most famous and expensive
hotels that looks like a castle.

Just past that, the street becomes morphs into something very different. There 
are businesses aimed at helping recent immigrants from Haiti and French-speaking
Africa. There are amazing inexpensive restaurants in buildings whose exterior 
has been largely ignored. There's a pharmacy that was shut down for an opiod
theft organized by the pharmacist that owned it.

There are always street youth panhandling, and the same group of older 
regulars who approach people waiting at the bus stops for money.

Further to the west this road becomes Wellington Street.

### somerset: Somerset Street

You are on Somerset Street.

This is the heart of Chinatown. There's a large paifang greeting those
who come. 

There's a large Vietnamese community in Ottawa and of the best phá»Ÿ outside of
Vietnam is found here, in restaurants that stay open until 4 a.m. You come here
often for some of that delicious broth.

Somerset is also home to a Chinese grocery store, amazing authentic Chinese
cuisine, and your favourite coffee shop.

### sussex: Sussex Drive

You are on Sussex Drive.

The Prime Minister's residence is located on this street, as is the Governor
General's. The mint is here too, along with the national art gallery and the
revenue agency. It's not unusual to spot the motorcade of the Prime Minister 
go down this street, or that of foreign dignitaries.

The American embassy is also situated on this road. They're easy to spot, as
they decided to permanently cut two lanes of traffic in one of the city's
most historic roads, placing ugly concrete barriers. Because the other set
of concrete barriers they already had, plus twelve foot tall steel fence,
and bomb-proof windows, was apparently insufficient.

### wellington: Wellington Street

You are on Wellington Street. 

This becomes Rideau Street further east. On this street is located the
Parliament and a series of buildings housing the bureaucracy supporting the
federal government. 

This street goes over the canal, which in winter becomes the world's longest 
ice skating rink. Every family in this city has brought their child to the
canal in winter.
