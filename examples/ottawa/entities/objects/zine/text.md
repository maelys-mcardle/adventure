There is a zine on display you can read.

## reading

You read through the zine.

It talks about mental health and trauma, and ways to manage. It is written
by and for queer people. 

You really appreciate zines like this. Therapy is expensive, and in Ottawa
you have therapists that really just don't know how to deal with trans and
non-binary people. They'll misgender you, blame everything on the fact that
you're trans, and say some really shitty things. And they're not necessarily
interested in learning anything better. Your last therapist was like this,
getting his education from television shows written by cis people, acted and
directed by cis people, who stuck to painful caricatures.

You flip through the rest of the zine. Some great stuff in here.
