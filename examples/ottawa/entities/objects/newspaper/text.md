There is a newspaper box with a newspaper inside.

## reading

You read through the newspaper.

There's stuff about what the American president is doing. You don't care.

You flip the pages. City residents are objecting to there being a new 
emergency shelter being built in their neighbourhood. The city is trying to 
shut down a pop-up safe injection site, which was only erected in response 
to municipal inaction following an overdose crisis. There are so many wealthy
residents here, given that so many people work for the government. It feels
like they live in a reality completely different than your own.

You flip the pages. There's an editorial advocating against the acceptance
of trans people like yourself. Ugh. There's one or two of these in national
newspapers every month, like clockwork.
