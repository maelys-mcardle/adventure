# house

## bedroom

You are in the bedroom. It hasn't changed since your childhood. Your pink
bed sheets. The blue walls. Your plush animals. Your polly pocket and 
transformers lining the shelves. Traces of your teenage self - the boxes
of video games you kept perfectly. The computer you built, and rebuilt.
An entire life that suddenly stops midway through university.

## upstairs_hallway

You are in the upstairs hallway. Paintings line the wall. The door
to the master bedroom is locked.

## upstairs_hallway -> stairs

You are going down the stairs.

## stairs

You are on the stairs. You see the step your mom's head was resting at,
as she cried. Only she's not there. 

## entrance -> stairs

You are going up the stairs.

## entrance

You are at the entrance. That painting covers the hole your dad did when
he punched it in anger. You didn't know it was there; he showed you, pride
in his voice.

## living_room

You are in the living room. It hasn't changed since your childhood either.
There's a beautiful large window overlooking the street. Your mom lives in
here, in the objects left behind. The old wooden spindle. The paintings from
your sister. Your dad lives on in the art. The inuit statues he purchased when
he lived up north.

## kitchen

You are in the kitchen. The counters are new. It looks so different than 
how you remember. There's a lot of food here; far more food than two people
would need.

# lawn

You are on the lawn. It's freshly cut. Maybe a neighbour did this.

# shed

You are in the shed. You hated this place. The disconnected pool equipment 
remains, though the pool is long gone. 

# street

You are on the street. A dense white fog blocks out the view of the other
homes. The air gets thick walking in any direction; you only seem to be
able to go back to the home.
